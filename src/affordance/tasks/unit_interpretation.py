Description: Solve the following arithmetic word problems, writing out intermediate arithmetic calculations as needed.
Input: A toy manufacturer receives an order for 400 toys. 5 workers are available to work on the order. 2 of the workers produce 6 toys an hour, and another 2 workers produce 4 toys an hour. They all work on the order during their 10-hour shift, and by the end of their shift the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to be able to ship the order. How many toys per hour does the fifth worker produce?
Q1: What is total number of toys that need to be made?
#1: 400
Q2: How many workers in total?
#2: 5
Q3: [arithmetic] How many toys do 2 of the workers produce?
#3: 2 workers working for 10 hours making 6 toys per hour produce 2*10*6 = 120 toys.
Q4: [arithmetic] How many toys do another 2 of workers produce?
#4: 2 workers working for 10 hours making 4 toys per hour produce 2*10*4 = 80 toys.
Q5: [arithmetic] How many toys did the last worker make?
#5: Out of 400 toys, 120+80=200 toys were made by the first 4 workers. The 5th worker didn't finish the job, since 20 toys were still remaining to be made. So they made 400-200-20=180 toys.
Q6: [arithmetic] How many toys per hour does the fifth worker produce if he worked for 10 hours?
